    Dear Mr. Clark,
     <br> <br>
        Let me first grab your attention away from any homogenous, "I would be an ideal candidate because..." cover letters you were skimming through, and start mine with an uncomfortable truth: I, Suzanne Matyas, am not an avid cyclist; urban biking frightens me, and I have never attempted it in DC. The reason I know that this statement will shock you, in particular, is because I have been hounding your website over the last month. In addition to the wealth of content geared towards cyclists, my eyes have also reviewed the staff webpage enough to be aware of your passion for sitting on those triangular seats while traversing both urban and rural terrains. For potentially displeasing you in this way, I apologize&ndash;but let me redeem myself by calling your attention to the three salient points I just surreptitiously made to convince you that I would make a fantastic Rails-to-Trails Conservancy (RTC) Web and Social Media Manager.  
        <div class="point"> >> Point #1: the Look.</div> 
        <p>
        This cover letter is an HTML and CSS sample piece I created from scratch for your eyes. Like its simple, yet functional design? As an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, I learned design theories as well as how to use Adobe Creative Suite while earning my minor in Architecture; I now apply these abilities to digital storytelling and marketing. If you have not already, please take a look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jVciXx5zL_OExKNDU0Z2Rvdms/view">resume</a> and a few of my <a href="#samples">design samples</a> to get a feel for what I could do as Manager. 
        </p>
        <div class="point"> >> Point #2: the Research.</div>
        <p>
        The skills I used to code this cover letter are under research and in progress. Although I gained experience managing websites from my Communications and Outreach Internship at the <a href="http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/"> US Climate Action Network (USCAN)</a> and as the Marketing and Communications Manager at the <a href="sfdc.org">Southeast Fairfax Development Corporation (SFDC)</a>, I am taking an HTML, CSS, and Web Design class to do all of this even better. My understanding of both languages, though regrettably not at Q's level from MI6, is advanced enough to deftly operate your Convio (now Blackbaud) CMS, and will jump to proficient at the class's end in March.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, my research into TRC allows me to confidently assert that my degree in Urban and Environmental Planning, professional experience with digital communications, and natural creativity are symbiotically suited for a position with your organization. Symbiotic, because the relationship would be mutually beneficial: my education grants me a systematic understanding of why and how to connect corridors, plus familiarity with GIS, and my experience has equipped me the ability to make the goal engaging and adoptable; in return, I get to do good work I am passionate about, while helping to create a nationwide legacy. 
        </p>
        <div class="point"> >> Point #3: the Call-to-Action.</div>
        <p>
        Lastly, I learned a little bit about your interests when performing my TRC reconnaissance. Using this insight, I elected to create a graphical resume to appeal to your design background, and then used my embarrassing biking admission to hook your attention. With a growing 160,000+  network and several on-going programs, courting the interest of your members to in an era of information-inundation is both imperative and challenging; it is also something I know I would excel at as your Web and Social Media Manager. Notice that last clause? That is the "initiative" I want you to support. Together you have the look, hook, program, and now let me push my Call-to-Action: <strong>support having engaging and efficiently managed digital content by advancing me to the next stage of the hiring process! </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        If given the opportunity to interview, I promise to make my city-cycling debut the mile and a half to your office along the TrailLink-scouted route down Rock Creek Park. At the very least, you will have inspired a newbie cyclist, and at best, you will have a new, passionate Web and Social Media Manager on the Trails-to-Rails Conservancy team.
